Sierra Suites Software - AWS POC Assessment - Page 2 of 11EXECUTIVE SUMMARYThe OpportunityThe construction industry loses $177 billion annually to preventable inefficiencies: delays, costoverruns, and rework. General contractors operate on razor-thin margins (2-5%) whilemanaging increasingly complex projects with multiple variables including weather impacts,material price volatility, safety compliance, and workforce scheduling.Sierra Suites Software has developed a comprehensive Construction Intelligence Platformthat addresses these challenges. We've built the complete infrastructure, user interface, andbusiness model for AI-powered construction management. Our platform currently servessmall-to-mid-sized contractors who are underserved by existing enterprise solutions.The ChallengeWhile our platform infrastructure is production-ready with 12 fully functional modules, our AIcapabilities currently rely on generic responses rather than data-driven intelligence. We needAWS's expertise to transform our AI features from demonstration placeholders into production-grade predictive systems powered by real construction data patterns.POC ObjectiveTransform 8 AI tools from demonstration to production by implementing machine learningmodels trained on publicly available construction datasets. This POC will validate the technicalfeasibility and business value of data-driven construction intelligence.Key Deliverables• 4 Core AI Tools: Smart Estimator, Project Predictor, Material Optimizer, SafetySentinel• 4 Additional Features: Timeline Prediction, Change Order Predictor, CarbonEstimator, Risk Scoring• Embedded Integration: Real-time AI analysis directly within project pages• Production APIs: Scalable endpoints for Next.js frontend integrationExpected Outcomes• Cost estimation accuracy within ±12% RMSE• Project timeline predictions with ≥85% accuracy• Material cost savings identification of 10-20%• Safety risk scoring aligned with industry incident rates
